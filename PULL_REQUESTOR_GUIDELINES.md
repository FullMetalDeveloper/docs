# Peer Review Requestor Guidelines

### In requesting a Peer Review, what are my duties? 
As an engineer requesting a peer review, your duties are split amongst the following main categories: 

#### Communication

When responding to feedback it is important to remember peer review is an exercise in education, collaboration, and respectful conversation. Requestors are obliged to keep comments constructive and respectful at all times. 

#### Code Under Review

Code is not a child, nor is its sole production the only measure of capability. Keeping this in mind, the code submitted for review should be aligned with the practices outlined [HERE](CONTRIBUTING.MD)

#### Documentation

Requestors are obliged to include documentation for code under review if asked, with the exception of minor changes or clearly understood code under review.

#### Escalations
If you as a requestor feel that unwarranted changes are being requested or a pull request was declined unnecessarily, you may request the review of an additional Senior Engineer.

No more than two Senior Engineers may be pulled in for review before an escalation is required to Director Level management.
