# Peer Review Requestor Guidelines

### In requesting a Peer Review, what are my duties? 
As an engineer requesting a peer review, your duties are split amongst the following main categories: 

#### Communication

#### Code Under Review

#### Documentation

#### Escalations
If you as a requestor feel that unwarranted changes are being requested or a pull request was declined unnecessarily, you may either re-open a pull request or request the review of an additional Senior Engineer.
