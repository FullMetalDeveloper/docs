> Our pages, who are in cache,
> Hello be thy name.
> Thy external libs come.
> Thy rendering be done
> On IE as it is on Chrome.
> Give us this day our daily JSON payload
> and forgive us our syntax
> as we forgive designers who have never coded.
> Lead us not into frustration
> but deliver us from pre-optimization.
> For thine is the interface, the user experience, and the business logic
> Looping forever and ever.
> Refresh.
