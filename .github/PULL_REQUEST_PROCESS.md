> Our pages, who are in cache,

> Hello be thy name.

> Thy external libs come.

> Thy rendering be done

> On IE as it is on Chrome.

> Give us this day our daily JSON payload

> and forgive us our syntax

> as we forgive designers who have never coded.

> Lead us not into pre-optimization

> but deliver us from frustration.

> For thine is the interface, the user experience, and the business logic

> Looping forever and ever.

> Refresh.
